# Project Name
National Wealth and Covid 19 Global Impact

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into the global trends relating to Covid 19. 

### Methods Used
* Histogram 
* Scatterplot 
* Boxplot 
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Pandas
* Jupyter
* Missingno
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Statistical functions

## Project Description
This project will explore the relationship between different countries’ economic wealth and total deaths; whether age has an impact on total deaths in a country; total Covid deaths and a country’s GDP as well as total deaths compared to total case to measure a country’s ability to treat Covid cases. 

The datasource is retrieved from [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data)which is a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty and disease.

Histogram will be used to list out the frequency distribution, central tendency. The relationship between two numeric variable will be shown by scatterplot. Also, boxplot is used to show outliers data.

We found that our data set had such a large number of values that we struggled to create scatter plots that were readable. We decided to clean up the data by choosing to narrow our scope to better illustrate different areas of our data.  

## Needs of this project
- Describe the core message
- Described the questions of interest
- Summarised where and how the data was found
- Described the data wrangling process
- Described the data exploration process
- Described the analysis process
- Summarised conclusions

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

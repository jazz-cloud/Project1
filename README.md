#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to gain insight into the global trends relating to Covid 19. 

### Methods Used
* Histogram 
* Scatterplot 
* Boxplot 
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Pandas
* Jupyter
* Missingno
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Statistical functions

## Project Description
This project will explore the relationship between different countries’ economic wealth and total deaths; whether age has an impact on total deaths in a country; total Covid deaths and a country’s GDP as well as total deaths compared to total case to measure a country’s ability to treat Covid cases. 

The datasource is retrieved from [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) which is a scientific online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty and disease.

Histogram will be used to list out the frequency distribution, central tendency. The relationship between two numeric variable will be shown by scatterplot. Also, boxplot is used to show outliers data.

We found that our data set had such a large number of values that we struggled to create scatter plots that were readable. We decided to clean up the data by choosing to narrow our scope to better illustrate different areas of our data.

## Needs of this project
- Describe the core message
- Described the questions of interest
- Summarised where and how the data was found
- Described the data wrangling process
- Described the data exploration process
- Described the analysis process
- Summarised conclusions

## Questions asked 
1.) Do countries with higher Hospital Beds per Thousand are expected to have fewer Total Covid Deaths?

2.) As a country’s median age increases, so will the number of Covid 19 deaths.

3.) Total Deaths will be lower in countries with higher GDP.

4.) Total Deaths as a percentage of Covid cases will decrease in countries with higher GDP.
